# Adaptive HCI
We investigate training adaptive human-computer interfaces with the aim of minimizing user interaction while obtaining good control.  
Currently, the main steps are
- **Pretraining**  
Use datasets to train a general model
- **Fine-tuning**  
Fine-tune general model on any past user data
- **Online learning**  
Train model online with interactive data
