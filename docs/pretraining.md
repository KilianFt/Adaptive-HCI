# Pretraining ideas

## Simulations
Use simulations to gather ground truth data for pretraining, in a fashion that is often done for image segmentation

## Datasets
Pretrain on as much data as needed. Some datasets are  
- Nina Pro
- CapgMyo (could only take part of electrodes as Alex did)
- [MyoArmbandDataset](https://github.com/UlysseCoteAllard/MyoArmbandDataset/tree/master)
